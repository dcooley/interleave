Description: Converts matrices and lists of matrices into a single vector by interleaving 
    their values. That is, each element of the result vector is filled from the input 
    matrices one row at a time. This is the same as transposing a matrix, then removing the 
    dimension attribute, but is designed to operate on matrices in nested list structures.
